There's all kinds of music
Everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast
Some like it slow
Some like it hot
Some like it blue
Some like it old
And some like it new

Now I'm not knockin' country
And I'm not rappin' rap
Big band swing just ain't my thing
Alternative ain't my snap

The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

Music makes you happy
Or it can make you sad
It can turn the worst day
To the best you ever had
For entertainment value
If I had to choose
You and me might disagree
'Cause I like rhythm and blues

Now I'm not dissin' disco
Not sayin' punk is bunk
