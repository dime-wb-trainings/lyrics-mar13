I said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?
